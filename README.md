# Steady State Distribution of an Ergodic Markov Chain
In this study, the aim is to calculate the steady state probability, i.e. Î , of an ergodic Markov Chain (MC). Two different approaches (Monte Carlo Simulation and Matrix Multiplication) will be implemented in R along with the comparison of their runtimes.
